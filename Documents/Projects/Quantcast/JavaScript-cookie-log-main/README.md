# Hello Quantcast team!!!
For the given assignment, I have used JavaScript language and for testing purpose you can follow the procedure.

Step 1. Extract the zip file.
Step 2. Open the cmd prompt (if windows) and bash: cd/(your file path).
Step 3. this is necessary only when you don't have node packages, if already installed you can ignore this step, Bash: npm install. (now the npm files and packages will install). 
Step 4. Bash: npm test. ( you should now see the test cases running).

If you want to manually check the result:
bash: node cookie-log.js -f cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
you will get to see the result: AtY0laUfhglK3lC7

Thank you
